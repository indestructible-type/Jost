FONTLOG for Renner*
===================

This file includes information about the Renner* typeface by indestructible type*.


About
-----

Renner* is an original font created by indestructible type*. It is inspired by 
the designs of Paul Renner. This is version 2.0.

Renner* is designed and maintained by Owen Earl (https://plus.google.com/103790404905174393616), 
who is the creator of the font foundry indestructible type* (http://indestructible-type.github.io).

Renner* was built from the ground up to work in the digital age. In designing 
Renner*, nothing about Paul Renner’s design for Futura was taken for granted. 
Letters were created to be the best possible iterations of themselves, while 
extreme precaution was taken to ensure that as a collective family, Renner* 
functions seamlessly. This has resulted in numerous notable differences between 
Renner* and Futura. Renner*’s weighting system is a bit different, to make it 
more inline with the typefaces of today. Renner* also has more balanced capital 
forms, for a better flow, especially at text sizes. It does this while retaining 
the elegance that defines Futura.
