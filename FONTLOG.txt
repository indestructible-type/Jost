FONTLOG for Jost*
===================

This file includes information about the Jost* typeface by indestructible type*.


About
-----

Jost* is an original font created by indestructible type*. It is inspired by
the 1920s German sans-serifs. This is version 3.7.

Jost* is designed and maintained by Owen Earl (https://ewonrael.github.io/),
who is the creator of the font foundry indestructible type* (http://indestructible-type.github.io).

During the 1920s there was a radical shift in German sans serif letterforms. A marriage between the
precise geometry of earlier German sans serifs with the clean legibility of the humanists coming out of
England, yielded a geometric sans serif that is so iconic that it still looks as futuristic and forward-
thinking as it did almost 100 years ago. Jost* is an ode to this era of type design. Instead of trying to
recreate it precisely, Jost* aims to capture the spirit, using the technologies of today.

Jost* has 9 weights, ranging from Hairline to Black. It can support many languages, includes stylistic
alternatives, and both tabular and proportional numbers. Using Jost* on the web is as easy as copying a
line of code into your webpage and includes automatic updates. As of version 3.0, Jost* supports OpenType
Variable Font technology that allows users to control the exact weight and italic of the font. Best of all
Jost* is still being actively developed meaning it will continue to improve and future updates may include
features requested by you! [Visit the website for more information!](http://indestructibletype.com/Jost)
