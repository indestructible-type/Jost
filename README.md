About
-----
Renner* was built from the ground up to work in the digital age. In designing 
Renner*, nothing about Paul Renner’s design for Futura was taken for granted. 
Letters were created to be the best possible iterations of themselves, while 
extreme precaution was taken to ensure that as a collective family, Renner* 
functions seamlessly. This has resulted in numerous notable differences between 
Renner* and Futura. Renner*’s weighting system is a bit different, to make it 
more inline with the typefaces of today. Renner* also has more balanced capital 
forms, for a better flow, especially at text sizes. It does this while retaining 
the elegance that defines Futura.

--------
Renner* was created using the free and open source font building application [FontForge](https://fontforge.github.io/).
To build it yourself you are going to need to download a copy of FontForge,
which you can get from their [website](https://fontforge.github.io/), or can be build using the [github branch](https://github.com/fontforge/fontforge/blob/master/INSTALL-git.md).
Start by opening the files located in the "FontForge Files" directory in FontForge.
In FontForge, unlink all references by selecting all (Ctrl-A) and pressing Ctrl-U.
Then remove all overlap by pressing Ctrl-Shift-O. Simplify, using Ctrl-Shift-M,
then round to nearist int by pressing Ctrl-Shift-_. Ctrl-Shift-G to generate
your font!

You can then add True-Type hinting following the instruction over at [ttfautohint](https://www.freetype.org/ttfautohint/).
