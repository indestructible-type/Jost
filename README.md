Jost* is an original font created by indestructible type*. It is inspired by 
the designs of Paul Renner. This is version 3.3.

Jost* is designed and maintained by [Owen Earl](https://ewonrael.github.io/), who is the creator of the font foundry [indestructible type*](http://indestructible-type.github.io).

About
-----
Jost* is a font for the digital age. It's based off of the work of Paul Renner, the designer of Futura. 
Jost* is an origonal font that aims to keep the attitude of Futura rather than the exact design. Futura 
was designed to be functional in its day and in that spirit, Jost* aims to be as functional as possible 
in the digital era. For that reason it deviates from the exact designs of Paul Renner, favoring, for example, 
a larger x-height. It also includes features, many of which would not be possible in the era of Paul Renner.
Jost* has 9 weights, ranging from Hairline to Black. It can support many languages, includes stylistic 
alternatives, and both tabular and proportional numbers. Using Jost* on the web is as easy as copying a 
line of code into your webpage and includes automatic updates. As of version 3.0, Jost* supports OpenType 
Variable Font technology that allows users to control the exact weight and italic of the font. Best of all
Jost* is still being actively developed meaning it will continue to improve and future updates may include 
features requested by you! [Visit the website for more information!](http://indestructibletype.com/Jost)

Building the Variable Font.
---------------------------
Jost* is licensed under the [SIL open type license](http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=OFL), meaning that it is free to use and modify. However, because of the difficulty 
associated with creating the OpenType Variable Font features, the compliled, functoning version of this font 
requires a payment of $10 or more on the website. However, if you'd like to build this font yourself using 
the source code, please use the following instructions:

  1. Download the complete source code, either by cloning this repository or downloading the .zip file.

  2. Download and install fontmake which can be found [here](https://github.com/googlei18n/fontmake).

  3. Navigate to the "Variable Font Files" folder and run `fontmake -o variable -m jost.designspace`. This 
should build the finished font file.

If you have any questions don't look at me, I don't know what I'm doing.
