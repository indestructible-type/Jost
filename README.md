Jost* is an original font created by indestructible type*. It is inspired by 
the designs of Paul Renner. This is version 3.2.

Jost* is designed and maintained by [Owen Earl](https://ewonrael.github.io/), who is the creator of the font foundry [indestructible type*](http://indestructible-type.github.io).

About
-----
Jost* is a font for the digital age. It's based off of the work of Paul Renner, the designer of Futura. 
Jost* is an origonal font that aims to keep the attitude of Futura rather than the exact design. Futura 
was designed to be functional in its day and in that spirit, Jost* aims to be as functional as possible 
in the digital era. For that reason it deviates from the exact designs of Paul Renner, favoring, for example, 
a larger x-height. It also includes features, many of which would not be possible in the era of Paul Renner.
Jost* has 9 weights, ranging from Hairline to Black. It can support many languages, includes stylistic 
alternatives, and both tabular and proportional numbers. Using Jost* on the web is as easy as copying a 
line of code into your webpage and includes automatic updates. As of version 3.0, Jost* supports OpenType 
Variable Font technology that allows users to control the exact weight and italic of the font. Best of all
Jost* is still being actively developed meaning it will continue to improve and future updates may include 
features requested by you! [Visit the website for more information!](http://indestructibletype.com/Jost)

Building the Variable Font.
---------------------------
Jost* is licensed under the [SIL open type license](http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=OFL), meaning that it is free to use and modify. However, because of the difficulty 
associated with creating the OpenType Variable Font features, the compliled, functoning version of this font 
requires a payment of $10 or more on the website. However, if you'd like to build this font yourself using 
the source code, the follow the following instructions.

Download the complete source code, either by cloning this repository or downloading the .zip file.

Download and install fontmake which can be found [here](https://github.com/googlei18n/fontmake).

Navigate to the "Variable Font Files" folder and run `fontmake -o variable -m jost.designspace`. This 
should build the finished font file. If you have any questions don't look at me, I don't know what I'm doing.
